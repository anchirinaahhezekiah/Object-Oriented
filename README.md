### 📝 Project Overview  
Welcome to the **Object-Oriented C++ Projects** repository! This folder contains **five C++ projects**, each demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **encapsulation, classes, and methods**. These projects cover fundamental mathematical and computational problems using OOP techniques.  

### 📂 Projects Included  

1. **Area of a Circle** – Calculates the area of a circle given the radius.  
2. **Area of a Triangle** – Computes the area of a triangle using base and height.  
3. **Volume of a Cube** – Determines the volume of a cube using its side length.  
4. **Find Maximum Number** – Identifies the largest number among user inputs.  
5. **Temperature Converter** – Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.  

### 🚀 How to Run the Projects  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anchirinaahhezekiah/Object-Oriented.git
   cd Object-Oriented
   ```
2. **Compile and Run a Specific Project**  
   ```bash
   g++ question1.cpp -o question1
   ./question1
   ```
   

### 📜 Features  
- Implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
- Uses **classes and functions** for modularity and efficiency.  
- User-friendly **input and output** for easy interaction.
